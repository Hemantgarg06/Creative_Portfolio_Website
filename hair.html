                <h3>My Story</h3>
                <p>
                    Vidal Sassoon was a British hairstylist, businessman, and philanthropist. He was noted for repopularising a simple, close-cut geometric hairstyle called the bob cut, worn by famous fashion designers including Mary Quant and film stars such as Mia Farrow, Goldie Hawn, Cameron Diaz, Nastassja Kinski and Helen Mirren.

                    He became an apprentice hairdresser at the suggestion of his mother. After developing a reputation for his innovative cuts, he moved to Los Angeles in the early 1970s, where he opened the first worldwide chain of hairstyling salons, complemented by a line of hair-treatment products.

                <h3>My Work</h3>
                <p>
                    Sassoon stated his intentions in designing new, more efficient, hair styles: "If I was going to be in hairdressing, I wanted to change things. I wanted to eliminate the superfluous and get down to the basic angles of cut and shape."Sassoon's works include the geometric perm and the "Nancy Kwan" hairstyles. They were all modern and low-maintenance.

                <p>
                    The hairstyles created by Sassoon relied on dark, straight, and shiny hair cut into geometric yet organic shapes.
